Megaromserver is a large collection of shareware, inactive, or otherwise abandoned personal computing software (DOS, Windows 3.x, Amiga, Atari ST, Apple II, Commodore, and more). Files are organized in [retropie](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Running-ROMs-from-a-USB-drive/#transfer-the-existing-retropie-file-structure) file system format. Browse the directory structure to download emulator-ready ROM and BIOS files using either the included GUI or with `wget` on the command line over my 5 Mbps uplink:

{% include megaromserver.html %}
