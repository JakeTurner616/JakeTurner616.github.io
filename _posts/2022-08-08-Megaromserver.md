Megaromserver is a large collection of shareware, inactive, or otherwise abandoned software. Files are organized in [retropie](https://retropie.org.uk/docs/Running-ROMs-from-a-USB-drive/#transfer-the-existing-retropie-file-structure) file system format. Browse the directory structure to download Emulator ready ROM and BIOS files using either the included GUI or with wget on the command line.
