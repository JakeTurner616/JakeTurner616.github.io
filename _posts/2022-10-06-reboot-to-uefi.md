## reboot-to-uefi

[reboot-to-uefi](https://github.com/JakeTurner616/reboot-to-uefi) is a simple batch / bash script to act as a clone of ASROCK restart to UEFI, but for non ASROCK motherboards.

## Usage (Windows):

One liner to download and execute (cmd running as administrator):

```batch
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JakeTurner616/reboot-to-bios/main/reboot-to-bios.bat > reboot-to-bios.bat && cmd /C reboot-to-bios.bat
```

Or clone/copy contents of `reboot-to-bios.bat` into a file with a `.bat` file extension, then run it as administrator.

## Usage (Most Linux OS's):

One liner to download and execute (privledged shell):

```bash
wget https://raw.github.com/JakeTurner616/reboot-to-bios/main/reboot-to-bios.sh -O - | bash
```

Or clone/copy contents of `reboot-to-bios.sh` into a file with a `.sh` file extension, then run it as a privledged user.

## Limitations:

- Script must be ran as privledged user - Will return an error otherwise.

- Might not work for certian motherboards with fast-boot / ultra-fast-boot on Windows.

- Might not work with some configurations of Windows fast-startup.

- Uses systemctl only on Linux as of now - Requires systemd as init system.

## Future ideas:

- Update Linux version to detect the active init system being used as to support more distros.
