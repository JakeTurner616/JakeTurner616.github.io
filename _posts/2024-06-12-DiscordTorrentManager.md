Create torrent categories in qBittorrent to associate the downloaded content with the folders they should be saved to (for example: movies --> Z://some/location/movies, and tv --> Z://some/location/tv). These are to be used with `/magnet <magnet_link> <category>` The category save paths could be set somwhere that has access to a media player like plex, jellyfin, a game folder, or anything really.
