[DiscordTorrentManager](https://github.com/JakeTurner616/DiscordTorrentManager) is a Torrent seeker and manager that you can use with your friends.

> The [initial](https://github.com/JakeTurner616/DiscordMovieBot) version of this project faced significant issues with maintainability and scope. This is the second iteration and aims to have a clearer scope and improved testability so it can be easily maintained and improved.

## qBittorrent Setup

1. Open qBittorrent and go to `Tools` -> `Options`.

2. Navigate to the `Web UI` section under the `Web UI` tab.

3. Check the `Enable the Web User Interface (Remote control)` box.
   
5. Set a network interface to bind the webui in the `IP Address` text box.

6. Set a username and password for the Web UI.

7. Create torrent categories in qBittorrent to associate the downloaded content with the folders they should be saved to (for example: movies > Z://some/location/movies, tv > Z://some/location/tv). These are to be used with `/magnet <magnet_link> <category>` The category save paths could be set somwhere that has access to a media player like plex, jellyfin, or anything really.

## Discord Bot Setup

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new bot application.

2. Create and copy the bot token.

3. Invite the bot to your server using the OAuth2 URL Generator under the `OAuth2` tab. Make sure to give the bot the necessary permissions for slash commands, reactions, and text.

## Configuration

Edit the `config.ini` file to include your specific environment settings for connecting to your discord bot and qBittorrent instance:

```ini
[Bot]
# change to your bot token
token = YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
# change to your server id
guild_id = YOUR_DISCORD_GUILD_ID

[qbit]
# change to your qBittorrent host and port:  http://host_ip:port 
host = http://10.0.0.123:8080
# qBittorrent WebUI login credentials
user = YOUR_QBITTORRENT_USERNAME
pass = YOUR_QBITTORRENT_PASSWORD
```

The bot can then be started by running the `bot.py` script.

## Command Usage

Here are the commands included with the DiscordTorrentManager bot:

- **Add a Magnet Link:**
    ```bash
    /magnet <magnet> <category>
    ```
    This command adds a new torrent to qBittorrent using the provided magnet link and associates it with the specified category.

- **Search for Torrents:**
    ```bash
    /search <title>
    ```
    This command searches for torrents based on the provided title. The bot will list the results, and the user can select a result to automatically download it to the 'movie' category. Assumes the 'movie' category exists.
