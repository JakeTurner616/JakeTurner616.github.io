These are to be used with /magnet. (/magnet <magnet_link> <category>) These could be set somwhere that has access to a media player like plex, jellyfin, or anything really.

```ini
[Bot]
# change to your bot token
token = YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
# change to your server id
guild_id = YOUR_DISCORD_GUILD_ID

[qbit]
# change to your qBittorrent host and port:  http://host_ip:port 
host = http://10.0.0.153:8080
# qBittorrent WebUI login credentials
user = YOUR_QBITTORRENT_USERNAME
pass = YOUR_QBITTORRENT_PASSWORD
```
