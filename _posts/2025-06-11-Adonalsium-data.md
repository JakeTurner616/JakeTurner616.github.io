<!-- BEGIN AUTO-README -->

Adonalsium is a project designed to map the intricate relationships within Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere universe. Inspired by the [Network of Thrones](https://networkofthrones.wordpress.com/), this project visualizes the connections between characters, locations, and events across the various books and series that make up the Cosmere.

### Live demo
You can view the current iteration of the web graph [here](https://ilijahp.github.io/Adonalsium/).

## Project Overview

These tools aim to provide an interactive and dynamic representation of the complex web of relationships within the expansive Cosmere universe.

### Key Features
- **Interactive Web Graph frontend:** Explore the relationships with a fully interactive graph that allows you to navigate connections in a visually intuitive manner.
- **Open Source data processing:** The project is open source, the entire edge and node creation process can be studied in the notebook.

## How It Works
Each node in the graph represents a character while the edges between nodes signify relationships based on the context of frequency of interactions. The process used is inspired by the network of thrones [data process](https://networkofthrones.wpcomstaging.com/from-book-to-network/).

### Technologies

- **Web Graph Visualization:** The interactive web graph is built using the [Sigma.js](https://www.sigmajs.org/).
- **Data Management:** The data was algorithmically organized and processed using [Gephi](https://gephi.org/).

## Getting Started

To explore the graph:
1. Visit the [Adonalsium Web Graph](https://ilijahp.github.io/Adonalsium/).
2. Use the interface to navigate through the relationships, zoom in on specific connections, and filter the data to find interesting relationship patterns.
